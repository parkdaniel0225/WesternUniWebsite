<p>Residence life is more than just a place to rest your head, it is a life changing experience in which you will make life long friends!</p>
<p>Fun Fact: originally all residences were named after local rivers. If you are driving around Southwestern Ontario, you might see rivers with the same name as Western residences.</p>
<p>There are three main styles of residences at Western. Below are residences styles and the building within each category:</p>
<p>- <a href="#traditional">Traditional Style</a> - one or two students in a small room and a shared washroom for the floor. <br />- <a href="#suite">Suite Style</a> - one student per bedroom with a shared kitchen between 4 students.<br />- <a href="#hybrid">Hybrid Style</a> - two students per bedroom but still a bit more private than the traditional style as the bathroom is just shared between 2 students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
